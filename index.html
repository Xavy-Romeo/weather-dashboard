   <!--
    1 - create the html based on the picture
        a. create header 
        b. search input
        c. create the section for the api response
        d. create the section for the forecast
        e. create the section for the search history
        -- doesn't need to be detail, it just needs a div or tag elements with ID's or classes
    
    2 - create the logic

        -----
        GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
        WHEN I search for a city
        THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
        WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
        THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
        WHEN I view the UV index
        THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
        WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
        THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
        WHEN I click on a city in the search history
        THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
        ------

    3 - create the api call
    4 - look for the response and save the object
    5 - local storage the object to call for a later time
    6 - test the html hooks and start displaying data on the browser
    7 - getting familiar with objects

        example of object 
        VVV
        {
            city: "London",
            UVIndex: "45",
            temperature:"145",
            country: "United Kingdom",
            date:"19/03/2021"

        }

        function(res) {
            console.log(res);
            let cityName = res.city;
        }
